## 📝 **Pre-Implementation Setup**

### ✅ **Documentation Created** 
**Time**: Initial setup  
**Status**: Complete

**What was done**:
- Created comprehensive deployment plan (DEPLOYMENT-PLAN-JUNE-24.md)
- Created progress tracking file (this file)
- Analyzed current codebase thoroughly
- Identified critical issues and requirements

**Key Findings**:
- Application is 85% complete but has critical data persistence issue
- Using MemStorage() which loses data on restart
- Communication system needs alignment with requirements
- Role-based access mostly implemented but needs verification

**Next Steps**: Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation
